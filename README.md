# to-do-list
Project

This first project is to create a basic to-do list program using vanilla javascript.

This project will refer to the to-do list tutorials at https://freshman.tech/todo-list/, https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp, https://medium.com/@suryashakti1999/to-do-list-app-using-javascript-for-absolute-beginners-13ea9e38a033, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtgY3a_TPg0.

As a first project, the goal of the to-do list is to learn the basics of a small, complete project that can be run and used.  I will also either customize the to-do list program as I work, or afterward as a revision to the original version.

Brainstorming ideas for future customization:
- add a pre-crossed to-do item "be your awesome self today"
- do screen sizes matter?
- add a priority tag and allow users to sort by priority
- pull in data from someowhere else (e.g., weather info)
- expand to a more involved productivity tasks
- allow users to share their accomplishments?
